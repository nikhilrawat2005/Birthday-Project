## 🌈 About the Project

This project is a **personal birthday surprise website** made with love.  
The site takes the visitor through several fun and emotional scenes:

1. 🐤 **Welcome Screen** — our ducky greets you warmly.  
2. 🎈 **Decoration Phase** — balloons, banners, and confetti appear one by one.  
3. 🍰 **Cake Cutting Moment** — the highlight of the celebration!  
4. 🐱 **Mini Game** — catch the falling kitties in a bucket held by ducky.  
5. 🎁 **Reward & Final Message** — a heartfelt ending message that completes the surprise.  

Every transition, animation, and interaction is designed to feel personal and joyful 💫
